# PokerRangeCalculator
Tool to compare two different poker ranges.

# How it works
Runs simulations with each hero hand (this is range whos winrate will be shown in the output) against random hands from the villian range (the amount of simulations run can be adjusted in the Simulaution tab). The output will show the winrate of each hero hand (not including splits).
